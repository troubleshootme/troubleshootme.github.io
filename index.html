    <h2>🌦️ Weather & Seasonal Intelligence</h2>
    <h3>Current Major Weather Events:</h3>
    <ul>
    
        <li><strong>Widespread Flash Flooding and River Flooding (Central Kansas (KS, Ellsworth, Rice, Lincoln, Saline, Ottawa Counties)):</strong> Multiple flash flood and river flood warnings are in effect across Central Kansas. Thunderstorms have produced 3-6 inches of rain, causing life-threatening flash flooding of creeks, streams, and highways. This poses a significant risk of delays and closures along the I-70 and I-135 corridors, disrupting a key east-west freight route.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Minor River Flooding (South Dakota (SD, Brown and Spink Counties)):</strong> Ongoing minor flooding of the James River continues to affect low-lying agricultural areas. While not directly impacting major interstates, this can cause local road closures and delays for first- and last-mile transportation, particularly for agricultural shipments.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Minor River Flooding (Central Florida (FL, Lake and Volusia Counties)):</strong> The St. Johns River near Astor is experiencing minor flooding, submerging docks and inundating yards near the waterway. This is unlikely to impact major highways like I-95 but could cause localized disruptions for deliveries in the immediate vicinity.</li>
        </ul>
    <div class="second-layer-enhancement">
        <h4>⛈️ Weather Impact Cascade</h4>

        <p><strong>Opening Script:</strong> "Based on today's market conditions showing over 130,000 available loads nationwide and flatbed rates climbing to $2.28/mile - 9 cents above posted rates - we're seeing the strongest post-Labor Day freight surge in recent memory. This isn't just seasonal uptick; it's genuine capacity tightening."</p>
        <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> By securing your freight at current market rates today, you're avoiding the 5-10% rate increases we're projecting for next week as Q4 demand accelerates and carriers gain even more leverage.</p>
        <p><strong>Urgency Creator:</strong> The gap between posted and paid rates is widening daily, especially on Southeast outbound lanes. Carriers are rejecting lower offers because they have multiple options at premium rates.</p>
        <p><strong>Objection Handler:</strong> I understand rate increases are challenging, but consider this: flatbed carriers are getting $2.28/mile when they were posting $2.19/mile just days ago. This market momentum means waiting will cost more than acting now.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.2em;">Capacity Shortage Communication</h3>
        <p><strong>Opening Script:</strong> "Current capacity indicators show reefer equipment at $2.35/mile with over 10,700 loads competing for trucks, while our primary Southeast region is experiencing the tightest van capacity we've seen this year. This means your regular lanes need immediate attention."</p>
        <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Our established carrier relationships in Atlanta and Charlotte corridors give you priority access to capacity that your competitors are struggling to find, but we need 48-72 hour lead times to guarantee coverage.</p>
        <p><strong>Urgency Creator:</strong> The Southeast is absorbing capacity faster than trucks can reposition. Every day of delay means fewer available trucks and higher rates for your shipments.</p>
        <p><strong>Objection Handler:</strong> While premium rates are concerning, service failures cost more than rate increases. We're seeing shippers pay 15-20% premiums for last-minute capacity because they waited for rates to soften.</p>
