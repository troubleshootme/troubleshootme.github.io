    <h2>📊 Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>Market volumes have normalized following yesterday's massive surge, with total available loads settling at 177,361—a healthy level that indicates sustained demand despite the post-Monday drop-off. The most critical operational threat today is the severe winter weather complex slamming the West Coast, specifically the I-5 corridor from Southern California through Oregon. With winter storm warnings active for the Grapevine and Siskiyou Summit, north-south connectivity along the Pacific Coast is severely compromised. This physical disruption is creating immediate capacity dislocations, driving up rates for equipment already positioned inside the affected zones. Nationally, paid rates are holding firm above posted averages for both Van and Flatbed, signaling that carriers still command leverage in key lanes.</p>

    <h3>Current Major Weather Events:</h3>
    <ul>
    
        <li><strong>I-5 Corridor Severe Winter Storm (Southern California to Oregon Border (CA, Santa Barbara, Siskiyou Counties)):</strong> Major disruption on the primary West Coast N-S artery. Heavy snow (up to 20 inches) at higher elevations including the Grapevine and Siskiyou Summit. Expect closures and indefinite delays.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Pacific Northwest Heavy Snow (Southern Oregon (OR, Jackson, Josephine, Curry Counties)):</strong> Difficult to impossible travel on I-5 and Hwy 199. Snow accumulations of 3-10 inches impacting Medford, Grants Pass, and surrounding freight hubs.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Wasatch/Uinta Mountain Snow (Utah (UT, Wasatch Mountains)):</strong> Heavy snow (1-2 feet) impacting I-80 and mountain routes. Traction restrictions likely; significant delays for east-west transcontinental freight.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Wyoming High Wind Event (Southeast Wyoming (WY, Converse, Platte, Albany Counties)):</strong> Extreme blow-over risk for light/empty trailers on I-25 and I-80. Gusts 60-70 mph. Likely closures for high-profile vehicles.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Sierra Nevada Winter Storm (Western Nevada/California Border (NV, Reno-Carson City Area)):</strong> Heavy snow and high winds impacting I-80/US-395 corridor. Travel difficult with whiteout conditions possible.</li>
        </ul>
    <div class="second-layer-enhancement">
        <h4>⛈️ Weather Impact Cascade</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Operational Impact:</strong> Today through Wednesday represents peak disruption for the I-5 corridor with heavy rain in California (0.7 inches precipitation forecasted for Tuesday) and continued snow in Oregon. The Grapevine and Siskiyou Summit are likely impassable or requiring chains, which effectively removes non-equipped trucks from the available capacity pool. Wyoming's wind event with gusts of 34-42 mph today creates immediate blow-over risk on I-25 and I-80, grounding high-profile vehicles. Utah's snow showers with 0.1 inches precipitation today will impact I-80 mountain routes with traction restrictions. These three simultaneous disruptions fragment the national network, forcing freight to reroute through Southern corridors.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Market Effects:</strong> By Wednesday-Thursday, expect 20-30% of Pacific Northwest capacity to be malpositioned or delayed, creating backhaul shortages in Midwest manufacturing markets that typically receive return loads from the West. This will drive up rates on Midwest outbound lanes as carriers seek to reposition equipment. The Southeast will absorb diverted freight volume, but capacity will lag demand by 48 hours, creating a brief rate spike Thursday-Friday. Reefer markets will see particular stress as freeze protection requirements in the I-5 corridor drive up operational costs, and the current inversion where paid rates ($2.60/mile) sit below posted rates ($2.64/mile) will likely correct as carriers refuse loads without premium freeze protection compensation.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Spillover Analysis:</strong> The West Coast disruption will cascade eastward through the week. By Thursday, expect Texas and Southwest markets to experience capacity tightness as trucks reroute south to avoid mountain passes. The Midwest will see secondary impacts Friday-Saturday as equipment that would normally cycle through Western states remains stuck or rerouted. The Southeast's current stability makes it a capacity magnet, but this advantage will erode by week's end as equipment concentrates there and outbound demand increases. The I-80 corridor through Nevada and Utah will remain problematic through Thursday with snow forecasted (0.2 inches precipitation Thursday in Nevada), extending transcontinental transit times by 12-24 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery Timeline:</strong> California precipitation decreases significantly Wednesday (0.0 inches forecasted) with conditions improving to partly sunny Friday-Saturday, suggesting I-5 corridor reopens to normal operations by Thursday afternoon. Oregon snow showers continue through Thursday (0.1 inches) but improve to partly sunny Friday, indicating Siskiyou Summit becomes passable Thursday evening. Wyoming winds moderate Wednesday-Thursday with calmer conditions Friday-Saturday, reopening I-80 to high-profile vehicles by Thursday. Utah shows improvement Thursday with cloudy conditions and reduced precipitation. Full network recovery likely by Saturday, February 21st, with normal capacity flow resuming early next week. However, the 4-5 day disruption will create equipment malposition that takes an additional 3-4 days to fully correct, suggesting normal market conditions return by Tuesday, February 24th.</li>

    <h2>💰 Financial Market Indicators</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diesel Futures:</strong> Diesel prices remain relatively stable around $3.65, providing a predictable cost baseline for carriers, though regional spikes are possible in weather-affected zones due to delivery delays.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrier Financial Health:</strong> Carrier profitability is seeing a short-term boost from weather-driven rate premiums in the West, but operational efficiency is taking a hit due to transit delays and lower asset utilization.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Indicators:</strong> The sustained high volume of flatbed loads suggests resilience in the industrial and construction sectors, providing a counterweight to seasonal retail softness.</li>

            Immediate capacity opportunity: HOS waivers extended through Feb 28 for heating fuel in Northeast/Midwest. This pulls specialized tanker capacity away from general freight, potentially tightening regional bulk transport markets. Brokers moving industrial liquids should secure capacity early as drivers prioritize these exempt loads.

            Strategic outlook: Massive downward revisions in trucking employment data confirm capacity has been leaving the market faster than realized. This validates the 'floor' we are seeing in rates; carriers have pricing power because there are simply fewer trucks. Brokers should prepare shippers for a structural shift toward a seller's market in Q2.

            Operational risk: New enforcement on English Language Proficiency (ELP) is leading to Out-of-Service orders. Brokers must vet carriers carefully, especially on cross-border or complex freight where clear communication is safety-critical. A driver placed OOS for ELP is a load that doesn't deliver.

            Long-term capacity impact: New FMCSA rule restricts non-domiciled CDLs to specific visa holders effective March 2026. While not an immediate cliff, this will gradually reduce the pool of available drivers, particularly for carriers relying on foreign labor. Expect tightening in border regions over the next 12 months.

        </ol>
    <div class="second-layer-enhancement">
        <h4>News Impact Timeline</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Operational Reality:</strong> The heating fuel HOS waivers active through February 28th are creating immediate capacity pulls in Northeast and Midwest markets. Tanker drivers who would normally be available for general freight are prioritizing exempt heating fuel loads, which reduces available capacity for industrial liquids and bulk transport. The English Language Proficiency enforcement is creating sporadic Out-of-Service orders that remove drivers from service unpredictably, increasing the risk of last-minute load rejections. Brokers should verify carrier compliance profiles before tendering loads to avoid day-of-pickup failures.</li>
            <li><strong>3-Day Market Implications:</strong> By Thursday-Friday, expect the combination of weather recovery and HOS waiver utilization to create unusual capacity patterns. Tanker capacity will remain tight through month-end, but van and flatbed capacity should begin normalizing as weather clears. The employment data revisions will likely influence carrier pricing strategies by week's end as carriers recognize their increased leverage - expect firmer rate negotiations Thursday-Friday as this information disseminates through carrier networks. The ELP enforcement will continue creating sporadic capacity removals, but the impact will be distributed rather than concentrated.</li>
            <li><strong>Week-Ahead Positioning:</strong> Next week (February 23-28) represents a transitional period where weather disruptions clear but regulatory impacts intensify. The heating fuel waivers expire February 28th, which will return tanker capacity to general freight markets by March 1st. However, the non-domiciled CDL restrictions take effect in March, which will begin gradually reducing available driver pools in border regions. Strategic positioning for next week involves securing capacity commitments before month-end when these transitions occur simultaneously. Expect rate volatility February 26-28 as markets adjust to multiple regulatory changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance Impacts:</strong> The March 2026 non-domiciled CDL restrictions will create gradual capacity erosion in border regions over the next 30-60 days. While not an immediate operational cliff, brokers should begin auditing carrier rosters for affected drivers and identifying alternative capacity sources for cross-border freight. The ELP enforcement requires enhanced carrier vetting processes - recommend implementing communication verification protocols during carrier onboarding to avoid OOS-related service failures. The combination of these regulatory changes with structural capacity exits suggests a tightening trajectory through Q2 2026.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
        
    <h2>🔍 Competitive Intelligence</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digital Load Board Trends:</strong> Paid rates are currently exceeding posted rates in Van ($2.27 vs $2.21) and Flatbed ($2.46 vs $2.45), indicating that real-time negotiations are favoring carriers. Brokers relying solely on posted averages will struggle to cover loads.</li>
        <li><strong>Capacity Alerts:</strong> Severe capacity crunch in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California due to I-5 weather impacts. Conversely, the Southeast remains fluid with ample capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Disruptions:</strong> Increased enforcement via digital tools (ELP checks, ELD revocations) is artificially removing capacity from the road, creating 'shadow tightness' not visible in truck count data alone.</li>
    
    </ul>
    <div class="second-layer-enhancement">
        <h4>Demand Shift Indicators</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regional Demand Predictions:</strong> The Southeast will likely experience 10-15% increased inbound demand by Thursday as shippers actively divert freight away from weather-compromised Western routes. This freight redirection, combined with equipment stuck in the Pacific Northwest, will create a secondary capacity squeeze in Atlanta and Charlotte markets by week's end. Expect outbound Southeast capacity to tighten first, followed by inbound tightening as trucks become reluctant to enter without premium rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Transition Analysis:</strong> We're in the transitional window before Florida produce season fully activates, which typically occurs in late February through March. Current hesitancy from carriers to enter Florida will reverse within 10-14 days as produce volumes increase and backhaul opportunities improve. This creates a brief arbitrage window where inbound Florida rates are elevated but will compress before seasonal demand drives them back up. The flatbed strength with 77,358 loads suggests construction season is beginning earlier than typical years, possibly due to favorable weather in non-storm regions.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Leading Indicators:</strong> The massive downward revisions in trucking employment data signal that capacity has been exiting faster than real-time metrics captured. This validates the rate floor we're observing and suggests structural tightness rather than temporary volatility. The sustained flatbed volumes indicating strong industrial and construction activity provide a demand floor that will support rates even as retail seasonality softens. The heating fuel HOS waivers through February 28th will continue pulling specialized capacity away from general freight, creating artificial tightness in bulk transport markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity Flow Predictions:</strong> Equipment currently stranded in Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming will begin repositioning Thursday through Saturday as weather clears. However, this creates a 72-96 hour capacity void in connecting markets. Expect trucks to flow from the Pacific Northwest toward the Southeast and Texas rather than attempting to reload in weather-affected zones. This repositioning will temporarily flood Southern markets with capacity by the weekend, potentially creating a brief rate softening Saturday through Monday before normal patterns resume. Carriers will prioritize weather-safe regions for the remainder of February.</li>

    <h2>👥 Customer Sector Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Retail replenishment is steady but facing delays in the West; advise customers of potential stock-outs in WA/OR due to I-5 disruptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Industrial output remains strong based on flatbed volumes; key concern is raw material delivery delays through Wyoming wind zones.</li>
        <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Produce shipping from CA/AZ is high-risk due to freeze potential; reefer capacity is commanding premiums for 'protect from freeze' service.</li>
        <li><strong>Automotive:</strong> JIT automotive lanes in the Midwest are stable, but monitor cross-country parts moves that traverse I-80 for weather delays.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>🗺️ Regional & Lane Analysis</h2>
    <h3>📍 Primary Region Focus: Southeast (Georgia/Carolinas)</h3>
    <p>While the West fights weather, the Southeast offers the most stable and profitable environment for brokers today. Freight is moving freely, volumes are healthy, and the absence of major weather disruptions allows for high velocity. Rates are stable but arbitrage opportunities exist on outbound lanes to the Midwest where capacity is tighter.</p>
    
    <h3>🛣️ Key Lane Watch</h3>
    
<p><strong>Atlanta, GA → Columbus, OH:</strong> <p>This lane is a reliable volume runner. Capacity in Atlanta is accessible, and demand into the Midwest manufacturing belt is consistent. Current spot rates are steady, but carriers are eager to head north for potential backhaul premiums.</p></p>
        
<p><strong>Charlotte, NC → Lakeland, FL:</strong> <p>Inbound Florida freight is commanding decent rates as carriers are hesitant to enter the peninsula without a guaranteed backhaul, though produce season is approaching. Demand for consumer goods into FL remains high.</p></p>

    <h2>🎯 Strategic Recommendations for Today</h2>
    <div class="recommendation-box">
        <h3>💼 For Customer Sales:</h3>
        <p><strong>Narrative:</strong> Proactively communicate weather delays in the West. 'The I-5 corridor is effectively shut down for reliable transit due to severe winter storms. We are securing capacity, but rates are elevated for safety and risk premiums.'</p>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> Audit all active shipments touching CA, OR, WA, WY, UT. Notify customers of potential delays BEFORE the truck stops moving.</p>
    
        <h3>🚛 For Carrier Reps:</h3>
        <p><strong>Sourcing Focus:</strong> Focus on regional carriers in the Southeast who are insulated from the weather. For Western freight, verify chains and winter driving experience explicitly.</p>
        <p><strong>Negotiation Leverage:</strong> In the West: 'We have the freight that is actually moving.' In the East: 'Stay out of the weather and keep your wheels turning with these regional runs.'</p>

        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.2em;">West Coast Weather Disruption - Rate Justification</h3>
        <p><strong>Opening Script:</strong> "I wanted to reach out proactively because we're tracking a severe winter storm that's shut down the I-5 corridor from Southern California through Oregon. Winter storm warnings are active right now, and we're seeing carriers reject contracted loads to avoid getting stranded. This is pushing spot rates up significantly in that region, but more importantly, it's creating transit delays of 24-48 hours for freight that's already in motion."</p>
        <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> We've secured capacity in the Southeast where operations are running smoothly, which means your freight moves on time while competitors are dealing with weather delays and service failures in the West. Our routing strategy keeps your supply chain predictable.</p>
        <p><strong>Urgency Creator:</strong> Capacity that's currently stuck in the Pacific Northwest won't be available for backhauls until Thursday at the earliest. Carriers are repositioning equipment to weather-safe regions, and we're seeing the Southeast tighten as a result. Booking in the next 24 hours locks in current rates before this capacity shift fully impacts pricing.</p>
        <p><strong>Objection Handler:</strong> I understand the rate is higher than last week. Here's the reality: paid rates are currently running $2.27 per mile versus posted averages of $2.21, which means the market is already paying premiums to secure reliable capacity. The alternative is booking at a lower rate with a carrier who may reject the load when weather worsens, leaving you without coverage. We're recommending routes and carriers that can actually perform.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.2em;">Southeast Capacity Opportunity - Proactive Outreach</h3>
        <p><strong>Opening Script:</strong> "While the West Coast is dealing with major weather disruptions, we're seeing a significant opportunity in the Southeast. Our market intelligence shows freight is moving freely through Georgia and the Carolinas with stable rates and good carrier availability. This is the time to move volume through reliable lanes while other regions are constrained."</p>
        <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> We can offer you consistent service and competitive rates on Southeast lanes right now because we're positioned in the most stable region in the country. While your competitors are paying premiums and dealing with delays in weather-affected areas, we're building velocity and reliability for your shipments.</p>
        <p><strong>Urgency Creator:</strong> This window is likely 3-5 days. As equipment gets stuck in the West and Midwest, we expect capacity to tighten in the Southeast by early next week. The carriers who are currently available and willing to run at reasonable rates will be absorbed quickly as freight diverts from problem regions.</p>
        <p><strong>Objection Handler:</strong> You might be seeing lower posted rates online, but those don't reflect the current reality. The spread between posted and paid rates tells us that actual transactions are settling higher because brokers need to secure real capacity. We're focused on trucks that will actually show up and deliver on time, which is worth the marginal rate difference when you factor in the cost of service failures.</p>

    <div class="second-layer-enhancement">
        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.2em;">Flatbed Industrial Freight - Capacity Commitment</h3>
        <p><strong>Opening Script:</strong> "The flatbed market is showing remarkable strength right now with over 77,000 loads available and paid rates holding steady at $2.46 per mile. What's critical for your construction and industrial freight is that severe wind warnings in Wyoming and winter storms in the Sierras are creating pockets where specialized equipment physically cannot move. This is forcing project freight to the spot market."</p>
        <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> We have committed flatbed capacity that's positioned outside the weather impact zones, which means your time-sensitive project materials and construction equipment move on schedule. In a market where weather is grounding equipment, reliability is the competitive advantage.</p>
        <p><strong>Urgency Creator:</strong> Wind gusts of 60-70 mph in Wyoming are creating blow-over risks that will likely close I-80 to high-profile vehicles. Equipment that would normally be available for your lanes is stuck or rerouting, which typically creates a 48-72 hour capacity gap as trucks reposition.</p>
        <p><strong>Objection Handler:</strong> The rate reflects the current market reality where flatbed capacity is balanced but weather is creating artificial scarcity in key corridors. The $86.6 million total market opportunity shows this isn't soft demand driving prices down - it's strong industrial activity keeping rates firm. We're pricing for performance and on-time delivery, not just the lowest number.</p>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Weather, not fuel, is today’s price driver</strong>: Severe winter systems are fragmenting capacity on the I-5 (Grapevine/Siskiyou), I-80 (WY/UT), and the Sierra corridor. Build 24–48 hour buffers and route south where possible.</li>
<li><strong>Use the national rate picture to anchor buys, then flex for weather risk</strong>: National averages show a slight buyer edge in Van and Flatbed, but a carrier edge in Reefer and Heavy Haul. Pay premiums only where the weather makes performance scarce.</li>
<li><strong>Southeast is your velocity hedge</strong>: Freight is flowing and reload density is high. Construct round-trips ex-ATL/CLT to cap buy rates before a likely Thurs–Fri tightening as diverted freight arrives.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance risks are rising in parallel</strong>: ELP (English Language Proficiency) enforcement is causing surprise Out-of-Service (OOS) events; HOS (Hours of Service) waivers for heating fuel are pulling tankers in the NE/MW. Vet carriers and document waivers up front.</li>
<li><strong>Diesel is stable and predictable</strong>: $3.651/gal. Price primarily for weather-driven scarcity, not fuel.</li>

<li><strong>I-5 Corridor (Grapevine CA, Siskiyou OR)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Assume chain controls/closures; require proof of chains and winter experience. Offer coastal US-101 only if time-insensitive; it’s slower and may still see disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>: Add weather premiums + explicit layover/chain-pay on rate cons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>I-80 WY/UT and Sierra NV/CA</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Avoid high-profile empties; prefer heavier loads. Reroute via I-10 or I-40 where feasible. Add “high-wind restriction” clauses.</li>

<li><strong>Action</strong>: Construct loops ATL→CLT→ATL and ATL/CSG→OH Valley (CMH/IND) with guaranteed reloads. Offer carriers day-certain turns to moderate buy rates.</li>
<li><strong>Why it works</strong>: High reload density and minimal weather friction convert to faster cycle times and better book-to-cover.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mid-South/Texas – Absorb diverted Western freight</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Prioritize I-10/I-20 corridors (ELP–DFW–HOU–MS/AL). Dispatch day-ahead for Fri delivery to beat the Thurs–Fri squeeze.</li>

<li>Van: Target buys near $2.20 on clean lanes; add weather premium selectively.</li>
<li>Reefer: Accept a carrier edge near $2.66; bake in freeze-protect SOPs and accessorials.</li>
<li>Flatbed: Use the −$0.03 paid-posted spread to negotiate down where weather is not a factor; project cargo near storms demands premiums.</li>
<li>Heavy Haul: Mild carrier edge; speed-to-permit and pilot scheduling can recover 2–3 cents in buy reduction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Accessorial discipline</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Itemize: chain pay, layover (weather), driver assist, tarp pay, and detention. Pre-authorization cuts mid-transit renegotiations.</li>

<h3 id="2472-hour-execution-plan">🧭 24–72 Hour Execution Plan</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Now (0–2 hours)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Audit all loads touching CA/OR/WY/UT</strong>; re-ETA with 12–24 hour buffers, insert weather clauses, and notify customers before failures occur.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-book SE/TX round-trips</strong> for Wed–Fri to lock clean capacity before Thurs tightening.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Next 6–8 hours</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Lock reefer capacity</strong> for freeze-protect moves; obtain telematics proof agreements and set-point on BOL.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-clear permits/pilots</strong> for any likely heavy/specialized wins—speed-to-permit is your margin lever.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Next 24–48 hours</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Reposition carriers south</strong> of storm tracks with reload guarantees; rotate PSW carriers into SE/TX where they can run clean and re-enter West post-recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Reprice transcon lanes</strong> that would touch I-80/I-5; offer southern alternates with reliable ETAs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-not-to-do">🚫 What Not To Do</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Don’t lowball PSW/PNW/I-80 WY freight</strong>: You’ll lose time and likely face a fall-off when weather worsens.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t accept rigid delivery windows</strong> in storm zones: Convert to time windows or add explicit weather exceptions.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t tender to unvetted first-time carriers</strong> for winter lanes: Verify ELP/ELD and winter readiness first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="broker-psychology-edge">🧠 Broker Psychology Edge</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Certainty &gt; Cents</strong>: Carriers will shave rates for guaranteed reloads and clear, safe routing. Shippers will pay modest premiums for transparent risk control and on-time outcomes. Package both—fast, credible offers beat cheaper, uncertain ones.</li>

<h3 id="quick-case-example">📚 Quick Case Example</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: SoCal to Portland dry van during I-5 disruptions.
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Move</strong>: Shift to a two-step relay: SoCal → Sacramento (relay) → Portland, using two winter-verified carriers with chain kits.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>: Premium vs direct, but reduced fall-off risk and a controlled ETA. Offset cost by booking the Portland truck to return via a SE-bound reload post-storm.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: On-time delivery within a 24-hour weather-adjusted window, preserved SLA (Service Level Agreement), and protected margin via planned backhauls.</li>
