    <h2>📊 Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>The national spot market is experiencing a significant weekend cooldown, characterized by softening rates and stable but stagnant load volumes. The most dramatic trend is in the flatbed sector, where the gap between posted and paid rates has widened considerably, offering substantial negotiation leverage for brokers. A key emerging industry trend is the continued decline in the average length of haul, pushing more freight into regional networks. Weather disruptions are localized, with minor flooding in the Southeast and Plains creating isolated capacity challenges, but the broader market remains defined by increasing capacity and downward rate pressure.</p>

                <td class="row-header">Vans</td>
                <td colspan="2">The van market continues to soften, providing brokers with a distinct advantage. Current paid rates are averaging $1.76/mile against posted rates of $1.85/mile, a nine-cent spread that confirms capacity is readily available for the nearly 14,800 loads on the market. This environment, combined with a broader trend of decreasing length of haul, means carriers are more focused on shorter, regional runs and are more willing to negotiate on rates to secure loads and maintain utilization. Driver availability is stable, and with load volumes holding steady but not increasing, brokers can confidently quote customers and secure capacity with improved margins.</td>

                <td class="row-header">Reefers</td>
                <td colspan="2">The reefer market shows a mixed but generally favorable picture for brokers. While average paid rates have risen slightly to $2.26/mile, they remain below the average posted rate of $2.32/mile, indicating that while demand for temperature-controlled freight is present, it is not strong enough to give carriers overwhelming pricing power. With available loads hovering around 5,500, the market is balanced. Late-season produce shipments are keeping rates firm in specific agricultural regions, but nationwide capacity is not constrained, allowing brokers to find equipment without paying significant premiums.</td>

                <td class="row-header">Flatbeds</td>
                <td colspan="2">The flatbed sector presents the most significant opportunity for broker negotiation this weekend. Despite a high volume of over 26,900 available loads, there is a massive forty-one-cent gap between the average posted rate of $2.21/mile and the average paid rate of just $1.80/mile. This indicates that posted rates are highly inflated and carriers are accepting substantially lower offers. This dynamic suggests a surplus of available flatbed capacity relative to demand, giving brokers exceptional leverage to negotiate favorable rates and significantly increase profit margins on loads.</td>

        <tr>
            <td class="row-header">OTRI Trends</td>
            <td colspan="2">Tender rejection rates are expected to remain low. The consistent and significant gap between posted and paid rates across all equipment types, especially flatbed, provides carriers with little incentive to reject contracted freight for a spot market that is paying well below advertised rates. This signals high contract compliance and predictable capacity.</td>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Broker leverage is elevated across all modes</strong>: <strong>paid &lt; posted</strong> on van (−$0.09/mi), reefer (−$0.06/mi), and especially flatbed (−$0.41/mi). Treat posted as a ceiling; buy off real paid rates.</li>
<li><strong>Flatbed is the margin engine</strong>: <strong>26.9k flatbed loads</strong> with a massive <strong>$0.41/mi gap</strong> signals oversupply. Push bids down decisively and string back-to-backs to lock spread.</li>
<li><strong>Regionalization accelerates</strong>: Shorter average length of haul (LOH) is pushing freight into <strong>Southeast and Midwest regional networks</strong>. Prioritize short/medium-haul coverage and reload planning.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity steady; compliance high</strong>: With low OTRI (Outbound Tender Rejection Index), contract freight is sticky; spot is price-taker’s market favoring shippers and broker margins.</li>
<li><strong>Weather risk is localized and tradable</strong>: Avoid Kansas I-70 through Monday morning; route via I-80. Central Florida flooding is last-mile localized—use real routing intel to undercut weather premiums.</li>
<li><strong>Diesel stable at $3.695/gal</strong>: Limited fuel volatility—hold linehaul; keep FSC (fuel surcharge) formulaic and resist ad hoc fuel adders.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate edge</strong>: Use paid-vs-posted spreads to reprice today’s tenders, target Southeast van/reefer buys, and aggressively compress flatbed buys nationwide.</li>

<h3 id="market-context-and-72-hour-outlook">🌍 Market Context and 72-Hour Outlook</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Spot landscape (Truckstop.com, high confidence)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Total loads 76,113; avg rate $2.07/mi; $93.1M opportunity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Van</strong>: 14,774 loads; posted $1.85, paid $1.76</li>
<li><strong>Reefer</strong>: 5,492 loads; posted $2.32, paid $2.26</li>
<li><strong>Flatbed</strong>: 26,943 loads; posted $2.21, paid $1.80</li>
<li><strong>Heavy haul</strong>: 13,932 loads; posted $2.35, paid $2.25</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>: LOH down near record lows—shippers favor regional DC (distribution center) positioning and intermodal for long-haul. Expect stable-to-soft rates unless a brief end-of-month (EOM) lift appears.</li>
<li><strong>Weather routing</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Kansas (Ellsworth County)</strong>: Flash flooding disrupts the I-70 corridor through Monday morning; shift linehaul to I-80 where feasible. Expect minor tightening in NE/IA by Monday PM.</li>
<li><strong>Central Florida (Astor)</strong>: River flooding impacts secondary roads only; I-75/I-4 clear. Limited, short-lived premiums inbound to Orlando.</li>
<li><strong>South Dakota (James River)</strong>: Minor ag-origin delays; not on major corridors. Add pickup buffers; use short relays.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Competitive dynamics</strong>: OEM tech (e.g., Volvo’s free load finder) increases carrier self-sourcing over 30 days. Brokers must win on planning certainty, payment reliability, and networked reloads—not just load matching.</li>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Southeast (primary hunting ground)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Why</strong>: High freight density, manageable weather risks, strong short-haul ecosystem.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>I-80 corridor (NE/IA) (tactical)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Why</strong>: Reroutes from KS increase flow; short-lived capacity tightness Monday PM—stage trucks Sunday.</li>
<li><strong>Tactics</strong>: Hold buys steady today; be ready for small premiums on time-sensitive loads Monday afternoon.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Midwest (secondary)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Why</strong>: Industrial base steady; hopper/FB capacity freed from grain. Pull into SE/DC freight for better utilization.</li>

<h3 id="behavioral-edge-you-can-exploit">🧠 Behavioral Edge You Can Exploit</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Posted prices are anchors, not reality</strong>: Carriers see posted as a target; counter with paid data and certainty (reloads, low dwell) to extract concessions.</li>
<li><strong>Risk perception &gt; risk reality</strong>: Weather headlines deter competitors. Use DOT/NWS specifics to book at standard rates where interstates are clear.</li>
<li><strong>Short-haul preference</strong>: Carriers prefer regional turns in soft markets; trade them utilization for cents—win-win and repeatable.</li>

<h3 id="tech-and-competitive-positioning">🛰 Tech and Competitive Positioning</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Operate “posted-as-ceiling”</strong>: Refresh paid-vs-posted every 2–3 hours on active lanes; adjust buy floors dynamically.</li>
<li><strong>Carrier scoring</strong>: Filter by on-time %, tracking acceptance, commodity history (food-grade, tarped steel). This halves tender-to-truck time and reduces fall-offs.</li>
<li><strong>Watch OEM load platforms</strong>: Expect gradual uptick in carrier self-sourcing within 30 days. Double down on value: fast detention resolutions, precise appointments, guaranteed reloads.</li>
