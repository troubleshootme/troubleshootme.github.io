    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 3.2em;">📊 Daily Market Intelligence Report</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> Friday, November 14, 2025</p>    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em;">2:42 PM CST</p>    <hr>
    
    <h2>📊 Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>Real-time spot data shows a sharp intraday jump to 107,418 available loads and $141.7 million in opportunity, yet the market-average rate has eased to about $2.12 per mile from the mid-$2.30s seen last week, signaling a volume-heavy but still carrier-competitive environment where brokers can aggressively source capacity and expand margins, especially in van. Flatbed and reefer remain the healthiest segments, with paid rates holding above posted levels on select industrial and temperature-controlled lanes, while diesel at $3.769 per gallon provides modest cost relief that is accelerating carrier exits and setting the stage for the capacity squeeze many analysts are warning about. Flood watches across Southern California and high winds in southeast Wyoming are disrupting key west–east corridors (I-5, I-10, I-80, I-25), creating time-sensitive reroute and rescue-load opportunities. The Southeast emerges as today’s strongest profit region for brokers, with pre-Thanksgiving retail and food flows tightening capacity out of Atlanta, Jacksonville, and other headhaul markets even as national tender rejections remain low but are starting to firm at the margins.</p>

                <td class="row-header">Vans</td>
                <td colspan="2">Dry van conditions are characterized by plentiful freight and still-loose capacity: roughly 22,951 van loads are posted nationally with about $31.3 million in opportunity, yet average posted rates at $1.89 per mile and paid rates around $1.84 show shippers still holding pricing power as carriers undercut postings to stay moving. Compared with a week ago, total load counts are up while the overall market-average rate has slipped from the mid-$2.30s to the low $2.00s, indicating that additional volume is not yet translating into stronger van pricing outside of a few hot spots like the Southeast and parts of Southern California. Equipment positioning remains relatively fluid as drivers chase higher-yield regional and short-haul work, which is keeping linehaul capacity abundant on many long-haul lanes, especially ex-Midwest and ex-Northeast. Seasonal influences from e-commerce and retail replenishment are slowly absorbing some of this slack, and early indications from tender behavior suggest rejections are inching up in select headhaul markets; brokers should expect van rates to firm modestly into Thanksgiving on outbound Southeast and port-proximate lanes while inbound freight into these same markets remains highly negotiable.</td>

                <td class="row-header">Reefers</td>
                <td colspan="2">Reefer freight is outperforming the broader market with 12,877 available loads and $26.8 million in opportunity, and the temperature-controlled premium is evident in posted rates near $2.38 per mile and paid rates around $2.34, only slightly discounted from earlier in the week despite the overall market-average rate moving down. Capacity is tightening first in food-heavy regions—Southeast, Upper Midwest, and key import/distribution hubs—where holiday poultry, frozen foods, and late-season produce are pulling trucks into grocery and cold-storage networks and away from secondary markets. Driver availability for long-haul reefer is more constrained than for van, as many carriers prefer higher-turn regional lanes that reduce empty miles and exposure to winter weather, which in turn supports stronger pricing on longer, multi-day trips into the Northeast and West. Historically, mid-November through year-end is a firming period for reefer, and current rejection patterns alongside paid-vs-posted spreads suggest brokers should anticipate steady to slightly rising spot rates over the next two weeks, especially on short-notice and weekend pickups where capacity must be bought off incumbents.</td>

                <td class="row-header">Flatbeds</td>
                <td colspan="2">Flatbed remains the most resilient segment as industrial and infrastructure freight underpin both volumes and pricing: there are about 32,753 available flatbed loads with $38.2 million in market opportunity, and notable, paid rates are averaging roughly $2.17 per mile versus posted rates at $2.14, indicating shippers are paying up at the margin to secure dependable open-deck capacity. This paid-above-posted dynamic contrasts with van and reefer and reflects tightness in certain corridors tied to construction materials, energy projects, and specialized freight where trailer type and securement expertise limit usable capacity. High winds across the central Rockies and High Plains are further constraining driver willingness to run light or high-profile flatbed equipment on I-25 and I-80, causing regional dislocations that can spike rates for time-sensitive loads needing safe alternate routing. Seasonally, flatbed demand typically cools into winter, but ongoing public infrastructure work and energy-sector activity are keeping many core lanes busier than a typical late Q4; forward signals from postings and bids point to stable-to-firm pricing on specialized and project freight even as generic steel and lumber moves see more competitive bidding.</td>

            <td colspan="2"><strong>$3.769/gal</strong> - Retail diesel at $3.769 per gallon, calculated from current state averages, is below peaks seen earlier in the year and is providing some operating-cost relief, but it is not enough to fully offset weak spot rates for smaller carriers running mostly on the open market. Larger fleets with fuel surcharge mechanisms are better insulated, while independent owner-operators are feeling margin pressure and accelerating exits or parking trucks, which will gradually tighten capacity into 2026. Brokers should recognize that lower diesel levels give carriers slightly more flexibility to accept marginal freight today, but the underlying financial stress from depressed linehaul rates means future supply reductions could be abrupt, particularly if fuel turns higher again.</td>

        <tr>
            <td class="row-header">OTRI Trends</td>
            <td colspan="2">Tender rejections remain historically low, confirming that contract carriers still have enough capacity to honor most primary commitments, but the combination of rising spot volumes and stable-to-improving flatbed and reefer pricing is starting to nudge rejection rates up in select regions such as the Southeast, Gulf Coast, and weather-impacted West. This early firming suggests the market is slowly moving off the absolute bottom of the cycle even though shippers still largely control pricing. Brokers should watch for localized jumps in rejections around Southern California (due to flooding) and port/inland distribution hubs feeding holiday demand, as these will drive the most attractive short-term spot opportunities.</td>

    <h2>🌦️ Weather & Seasonal Intelligence</h2>
    <h3>Current Major Weather Events:</h3>
    <ul>
    
        <li><strong>Heavy rain and flood risk across Southern California coastal and valley corridors (Southern California (CA, Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara counties including I-5, US-101, and key urban surface routes)):</strong> Flood watches covering the Los Angeles Basin, Ventura, and Santa Barbara coastal and mountain zones are likely to cause roadway flooding, mudslides on canyon roads, and intermittent closures along I-5, US-101, and key artery routes into the ports and regional distribution centers, leading many carriers to pad transit times or avoid same-day pickups in low-lying industrial districts. Expect appointment delays at warehouses, higher detention risk, and selective capacity tightening for loads picking up or delivering during the heaviest rainfall window through Saturday evening; brokers should proactively communicate ETA slippage and consider routing through drier inland alternatives where feasible.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Desert flash flood potential impacting I-10 and freight near Joshua Tree (Southern California Desert (CA, Chiriaco Summit and western Joshua Tree National Park area along I-10)):</strong> Flood watches around Chiriaco Summit and western Joshua Tree indicate a risk of rapid runoff and flooded low-water crossings near I-10, which can temporarily close segments or force slow-moving convoys through affected stretches between the Inland Empire and eastern desert distribution points. Long-haul east–west freight using I-10 as a primary corridor may face detours or speed restrictions that tighten available capacity for same-day and next-day pickups out of the Inland Empire; brokers should flag high-priority loads for earlier tendering and consider shifting time-sensitive freight north to I-40 or south to alternate routes where weather permits.</li>
        
        <li><strong>High winds across southeast Wyoming mountain corridors (Southeast Wyoming (WY, Bordeaux area on I-25 and North Snowy Range Foothills near I-80)):</strong> High wind warnings with gusts up to 60 mph along I-25 between Chugwater and Wheatland and across the North Snowy Range Foothills on I-80 create hazardous crosswinds for light and high-profile vehicles, prompting frequent travel advisories and occasional restrictions for empty or lightly loaded trailers. These conditions slow transcontinental freight and discourage some carriers from accepting loads that must cross this segment overnight, tightening capacity on I-80 and alternative north–south bypasses; brokers arranging West-to-Midwest or Front Range traffic should anticipate longer transit times, a carrier preference for heavier loads, and potential spot premiums on trucks willing to route through the affected corridor.</li>
        </ul>
    <div class="second-layer-enhancement">
        <h4>⛈️ Weather Impact Cascade</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Operational Impact:</strong> Through Saturday, expect significant delays on I-5, I-10, and US-101 in Southern California due to heavy rain and flooding. High winds on I-80 and I-25 in Wyoming will slow transit and may lead to restrictions on light/empty trailers.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Market Effects:</strong> The disruption in Southern California will likely tighten capacity in Phoenix and Las Vegas as shippers seek alternative outbound gateways. Freight normally routed on I-10 may be diverted to I-40, increasing volume through markets like Flagstaff and Albuquerque.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Spillover Analysis:</strong> Persistent high winds on I-80 in Wyoming could push some transcontinental freight south to I-70, creating a modest tightening effect on capacity originating in Denver. Delays in Southern California will disrupt network balance for national carriers, potentially causing tight capacity on seemingly unrelated lanes early next week.</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery Timeline:</strong> Based on the forecast, Southern California operations will likely remain disrupted through Monday, with a potential for normalization to begin on Tuesday when rain subsides. The high winds in Wyoming are forecast to persist, suggesting operational challenges will continue into early next week.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
            
    <h2>💰 Financial Market Indicators</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diesel Futures:</strong> Diesel futures have been hovering in a relatively narrow band as global crude prices balance geopolitical risk against softer economic growth expectations, which suggests near-term pump prices are more likely to drift sideways than spike. This stability allows carriers to plan fuel budgets with a bit more confidence and reduces the urgency of fuel-surcharge escalators, but it also means linehaul rate changes will be driven more by capacity exits and demand shifts than by fuel shocks. Brokers can use the calmer fuel backdrop to push for longer-term spot commitments at current all-in levels, emphasizing predictability over short-lived surcharges.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrier Financial Health:</strong> Carrier financial health remains fragile: prolonged weak spot rates, higher insurance premiums, and tighter lending standards are squeezing small and midsize fleets, while new regulatory scrutiny on driver qualifications and non-domiciled CDLs is poised to remove additional drivers from the labor pool. Recent commentary from industry analysts points to an ongoing purge of marginal capacity rather than a rapid bounce, implying that while today’s market still feels loose, the groundwork is being laid for a much tighter environment once demand improves. Brokers should expect continued bankruptcies and capacity consolidation and should deepen relationships with well-capitalized carriers now to avoid future exposure when the market flips.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Indicators:</strong> Freight demand is being held back by sluggish manufacturing and uneven goods consumption, as reflected in recent freight payment and port/rail indices that show volumes down from last year but not collapsing further. Retailers remain cautious on inventories ahead of the holidays, prioritizing just-in-time replenishment over big forward buys, which is keeping a floor under truckload volumes without producing a full peak season. For brokers, this translates into a market where tactical surges—driven by promotions, weather, or localized restocking—offer the best margin opportunities, rather than broad-based nationwide tightness.</li>
    </ul>

            California’s move to revoke approximately 17,000 non-domiciled CDLs following federal scrutiny means fleets using foreign-based drivers face an immediate need to verify credentials and potentially sideline non-compliant drivers. For brokers, this raises the risk of last-minute truck cancellations on loads originating or terminating in California and neighboring states, particularly on long-haul and drayage work that leans heavily on these drivers. In quoting, build in slightly wider pickup windows and avoid over-promising service on new California-origin freight until carrier rosters stabilize; in capacity sourcing, press carriers for confirmation that assigned drivers hold compliant, valid CDLs and document those assurances in the load record. Customer-facing teams should frame any emerging service disruptions as tied to enhanced federal safety and credential enforcement, using it as justification for rate floors or accessorials tied to driver substitutions and recovery loads.

            The latest port and rail ramp freight index indicates that container volumes and inland ramp activity have cooled from prior peaks, which is easing congestion and making drayage and transload capacity more accessible and price-competitive in most major gateways. Brokers can leverage this in two ways: first, by pushing for sharper truckload rates on port-to-DC moves where terminals are more fluid and turn times are improving, and second, by bundling drayage plus linehaul solutions at consistent all-in pricing to win share from shippers frustrated with fragmented intermodal service. Reduced congestion also means better schedule reliability, so sales teams should highlight improved on-time performance and lower dwell risk to justify shifting more freight into truckload or hybrid dray-truck solutions as an alternative to slower rail routings.

            A public discussion between industry executives underscores a key inflection: while overall freight demand remains soft, spot rates appear to be slowly firming from cyclical lows, raising questions about how much excess capacity actually remains in the system. For brokers, this means the days of automatic rate cuts on every rebid are likely numbered, especially on lanes where carriers are signaling improving leverage through higher minimums or reduced multi-stop flexibility. In pricing strategy, brokers should start inching quotes upward on tight equipment types and regions—particularly flatbed and reefer in the Southeast and energy corridors—while holding the line on discounts for commoditized van lanes. With shippers still anchored to “bottom of the market” expectations, customer conversations should emphasize mounting carrier exits, regulatory headwinds, and weather disruptions as reasons to prioritize service stability over chasing the absolute lowest rate.

            The new federal initiative to study how driver schedules relate to crash risk signals that hours-of-service and fatigue management will remain a high priority and could see adjustments once data is analyzed. While no immediate rule changes are in effect, brokers should anticipate a future environment where certain schedule patterns—such as extended night driving or rapid flip-flop resets—may become less acceptable or more tightly monitored. Operationally, this is a strong cue to start capturing and analyzing more granular pickup, delivery, and dwell-time data so that lanes can be redesigned around realistic rest windows and compliant cycle times, strengthening the brokerage’s ability to defend transit commitments. In shipper discussions, this study can be used to justify stricter cut-off times, reduced tolerance for chronic loading delays, and the introduction or enforcement of detention and layover charges tied directly to safety and compliance concerns.

        <h4>News Impact Timeline</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Operational Reality:</strong> Effective immediately, all loads originating in California require verification that the assigned driver holds a compliant, domiciled CDL. Failure to do so risks last-minute cancellations and compliance violations.</li>
            <li><strong>3-Day Market Implications:</strong> Over the next 72 hours, expect an increase in anecdotal reports of truck fallouts on California lanes. Competitors who are not proactively vetting drivers will likely experience higher failure rates, creating opportunities for rescue loads.</li>
            <li><strong>Week-Ahead Positioning:</strong> By early next week, the market will begin to price in the reduced driver pool. Proactively build a roster of verified, compliant California carriers and begin educating customers on why rates for California freight must reflect this new reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance Impacts:</strong> The FMCSA crash-risk study is a long-term signal. Begin capturing more granular data on shipper detention and transit times now to build a baseline that can be used to justify future accessorial charges or lane re-designs based on safety and compliance.</li>

    <h2>🔍 Competitive Intelligence</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digital Load Board Trends:</strong> Real-time load board data shows today’s total available loads jumping above 107,000 compared with roughly 79,000 just two days ago and similar levels a week ago, yet the average spot rate has slipped to around $2.12 per mile from the mid-$2.30s over that same period. This divergence—higher postings but lower pricing—indicates a market where shippers are pushing more volume into the spot channel without needing to materially bid up rates because carrier competition remains intense. Flatbed stands out as an exception, with paid rates running slightly above postings, confirming localized tightness on specialized freight, while van and reefer continue to see paid rates a bit below postings as carriers undercut each other to secure freight. Brokers with strong real-time rate visibility can exploit this by underbidding slower-moving competitors on commoditized lanes while still maintaining healthy margins through aggressive carrier negotiations.</li>
        <li><strong>Capacity Alerts:</strong> Capacity remains broadly abundant for dry van across most of the country, especially on long-haul Midwest and Northeast outbound lanes, but is tightening in the Southeast where holiday retail and food demand is ramping. Reefer capacity is notably tighter into and out of grocery-heavy markets and import-fed cold storage hubs, while flatbed availability is constrained around major construction and energy corridors in the Gulf Coast, Texas, and parts of the Carolinas. Weather-related disruptions in Southern California and high-wind zones in Wyoming are creating temporary capacity pinch points as carriers re-route trucks, which brokers can capitalize on by covering rescue and recovery loads at a premium while offering alternate routing options to shippers.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Disruptions:</strong> The broader market continues to shift toward automated pricing, digital tendering, and data-driven carrier performance scoring, enabling faster reaction to intraday changes in capacity and rates. As more shippers adopt dynamic routing guides and real-time benchmark tools, brokers who still rely on static rate tables or manual spot quotes risk being outmaneuvered. At the same time, increasing use of telematics and ELD data in safety and compliance initiatives—such as the new crash-risk schedule study—will push the industry toward more transparent and shared operational data. For a brokerage, doubling down on integrated TMS, automated rating, and analytics that combine internal performance with external market signals is becoming a prerequisite to</li>

        <h4>Demand Shift Indicators</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regional Demand Predictions:</strong> Over the next 7 days, expect a surge in van and reefer demand originating in the Southeast as the pre-Thanksgiving shipping window closes. Demand out of Southern California may appear artificially low due to weather suppressing pickups, but a backlog will likely create a surge early next week.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Transition Analysis:</strong> The current pre-Thanksgiving ramp-up in the Southeast is consistent with typical seasonal patterns. However, the overall market softness means this 'peak' is manifesting as regional tightening rather than a nationwide rate spike, which is atypical for mid-November.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Leading Indicators:</strong> The continued focus on just-in-time replenishment by retailers suggests that any spot demand surges will be short-lived and geographically concentrated. This creates opportunities for agile brokers but signals that a broad-based, sustained recovery in demand is not yet imminent.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity Flow Predictions:</strong> Expect empty trucks to reposition towards the Southeast from the Midwest and Northeast to service higher-paying outbound freight. Some West Coast capacity may shift towards Arizona and Nevada to avoid the operational headaches in Southern California.</li>

        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.2em;">Rate Increase Justification</h3>
        <p><strong>Opening Script:</strong> "Based on today's market conditions showing carrier exits accelerating and spot rates beginning to 'melt up' from the bottom, we're seeing a clear firming trend in key regions. To ensure service reliability for your upcoming shipments, we should review pricing, especially for freight moving out of the Southeast."</p>
        <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> By securing capacity at a stable, predictable rate now, you can avoid the premium pricing and service failures that are becoming more common as the market tightens ahead of the holidays.</p>
        <p><strong>Urgency Creator:</strong> With pre-Thanksgiving retail flows already tightening the Southeast and weather disrupting West Coast lanes, the window to lock in reliable trucks at current levels is closing quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Objection Handler:</strong> While the national *average* rate has eased, our data shows paid rates for resilient segments like flatbed are already above posted averages, and tender rejections in hot markets are climbing. We are pricing for the reality on your specific lanes to guarantee service, not just chasing a national number that doesn't reflect regional tightness.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.2em;">Capacity Shortage Communication</h3>
        <p><strong>Opening Script:</strong> "Current capacity indicators show a combination of factors creating significant regional tightness. Specifically, flood watches across Southern California are causing operational delays, and California's recent revocation of 17,000 driver licenses is starting to remove trucks from the available pool. This means securing compliant, reliable capacity on West Coast lanes requires more lead time."</p>
        <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Booking your California-origin freight with us now ensures we can secure a fully vetted, compliant carrier and proactively plan routes around weather-impacted areas, protecting your supply chain from costly delays and compliance risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Urgency Creator:</strong> The rain in Southern California is forecast to continue through Monday, and the driver compliance issue is ongoing. We anticipate capacity will get progressively tighter as shippers compete for a shrinking pool of available trucks.</p>
        <p><strong>Objection Handler:</strong> We understand the desire for lower prices, but the immediate risks of compliance violations and weather delays in California are significant. Our rate reflects the additional diligence required to source a verified, compliant driver and manage the operational challenges to ensure your freight delivers safely and on time.</p>

<li><strong>Segment split matters</strong>: <strong>Reefer and flatbed are healthiest</strong> (reefer posted $2.38/mi vs paid $2.34; flatbed posted $2.14 vs paid $2.17). <strong>Van stays buyer-friendly nationally</strong> (posted $1.89 vs paid $1.84), with <strong>localized firmness outbound SE</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Weather/regulatory premiums are real</strong>: <strong>SoCal flood watches (I-5, US-101, I-10)</strong> and <strong>WY high winds (I-80/I-25)</strong> drive <strong>+7–12% spot premiums</strong> where timelines can’t slip. <strong>CA revocation of ~17k non-domiciled CDLs</strong> increases fallout risk; <strong>tighten driver vetting and widen windows</strong>.</li>
