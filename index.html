    <h2>üìä Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>The national freight market is experiencing a significant divergence in conditions. While overall load volumes have dipped from yesterday's peak, they remain strong, with a notable upward trend over the past five days. The dominant story is a severe heatwave across the Southeast and Midwest, creating critical operating conditions that are tightening reefer capacity and driving paid rates significantly above posted averages. This presents a key opportunity for brokers. In major industry news, the withdrawal of the speed limiter mandate provides long-term relief for carriers, while ongoing consolidation in the load board space signals a continuing technology race.</p>

                <td colspan="2">The van market shows signs of softening from yesterday's highs, with current paid rates at $1.82/mile slightly below the average posted rate of $1.84/mile. This indicates a slight easing of the intense capacity crunch seen previously. However, with available loads at 17,898 and the broader five-day trend showing increasing volume, the market remains active. This slight dip in paid rates may offer a brief window for brokers to secure capacity at more favorable costs before the general upward trend in volume potentially tightens the market again.</td>

    <div class="second-layer-enhancement">
        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.2em;">Capacity Shortage Communication</h3>
        <p><strong>Opening Script:</strong> "Current capacity indicators show reefer equipment availability is critically constrained across the Southeast, with carriers actively avoiding the region due to extreme heat conditions reaching 110-116¬∞F heat index values. This means securing reliable capacity requires immediate action and premium pricing"</p>
        <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Our established carrier relationships in heat-affected regions give us access to equipment that other brokers can't secure, ensuring your freight moves when others face service failures</p>
        <p><strong>Urgency Creator:</strong> With the heatwave persisting and agricultural produce movement at seasonal peaks, every hour of delay reduces available capacity options and increases costs</p>
        <p><strong>Objection Handler:</strong> While capacity costs are elevated, the risk of not securing equipment now means potential delays, product spoilage, and emergency freight costs that far exceed current market premiums</p>
