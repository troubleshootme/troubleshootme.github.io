                <td colspan="2">Reefer conditions are notably tight with paid rates reaching $2.34/mile against posted $2.27/mile on 7,184 loads, reflecting capacity strains as fall produce harvests drive selective carrier acceptance and limit equipment flexibility in temperature-controlled networks that have seen volumes climb from prior benchmarks. These dynamics are amplified by driver constraints on specialized routes and positioning challenges from agricultural origins, where cooler weather is intensifying demand cycles without proportional reefer unit influx; West Coast and Southwest variations highlight rerouting needs boosting empty miles and premiums. As historical patterns indicate seasonal peaks through late October, expect continued rate elevation tied to capacity absorption, positioning brokers to capitalize on high-value perishables by locking in dedicated carriers ahead of potential export upticks.</td>
