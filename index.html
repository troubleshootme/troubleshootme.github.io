<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Spot market is tightening with paid rates exceeding posted in reefer and flatbed; vans are stable-to-soft.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Reefer paid $2.39/mi vs posted $2.35; flatbed paid $2.29/mi vs posted $2.25; van paid $1.89/mi vs posted $1.91.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Southeast is the power center; Florida weather is the catalyst.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Thunderstorms and minor flooding in FL through midweek will delay turns and create spillover demand in GA/AL/Carolinas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Capacity power rests with specialized carriers; van leverage is broker-friendly in balanced markets.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Expect higher OTRI (Outbound Tender Rejection Index) in reefer/flatbed; van rejections vary by hub and feeder lanes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Margin window is open for brokers who pre-book and control the reload.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Backhaul into Florida + pre-arranged outbound = best gross margin setup today.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shippers are increasing safety scrutiny; elevate your vetting and communicate risk management as a value add.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Position compliance as operational insurance alongside their financial insurance policies.</li>

<h3 id="2472-hour-scenario-map-probability-weighted">24–72 Hour Scenario Map (Probability-Weighted) 🎯</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Base case (60%): Southeast tightens through midweek; reefer/flatbed rates firm 1–3% with paid>posted persisting.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Action: Prioritize pre-booking 2-load packages (inbound FL + outbound GA/AL/Carolinas) for reefer/flatbed. Quote van conservatively; negotiate buys down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bullish tightness (25%): Florida disruptions ripple harder; reefer tender rejections spike; flatbed gets spillover from delayed sites.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Action: Move to hold-and-call pricing for reefer/flatbed (quote bands, 2–3 hour validity). Lock capacity with commitment notes and enforce strict appointment buffers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Soft patch (15%): Analyst “rate drop” call spooks some shippers; van spot dips 1–2% in Midwest/Plains while Southeast remains tight.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Action: Use softer van buys in balanced markets to subsidize capacity for your tight Southeast freight. Keep shipper quotes anchored to current regional tightness, not national headlines.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="regional-strike-plan-southeast-plays">Regional Strike Plan: Southeast Plays 🗺️</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Atlanta, GA → Orlando, FL (Van + Reefer)</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Use inbound-to-FL as the carrot: pre-book outbound (Orlando/Tampa/JAX) first, then backfill inbound at competitive buys.</li>
<li>Target buy bands today (adjust to live comps):</li>
<li>Van: cost target $2.00–$2.25/mi if outbound is secured; sell $2.30–$2.55/mi.</li>
<li>Reefer: cost target $2.45–$2.75/mi; sell $2.75–$3.05/mi given paid>posted and weather risk.</li>
<li>Playbook: Offer carriers guaranteed outbound within 12–24 hours, named facility, and appointment times to overcome “Florida reluctance.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Savannah, GA → Charlotte, NC (Van + Flatbed)</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Short-haul, high-velocity port-to-DC (distribution center) move; speed matters more than pennies.</li>
<li>Target buy bands:</li>
<li>Van: cost target $2.35–$2.55/mi; sell $2.65–$2.95/mi.</li>
<li>Flatbed: cost target $2.70–$3.00/mi (short haul premium); sell $3.00–$3.40/mi where time-definite or tarping required.</li>
<li>Playbook: Build a 2–3 load rolling program with regional carriers; lock them for M/W/F blocks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tri-haul Escapes for Florida Inbounds</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Example: Atlanta → Orlando → Jacksonville → Savannah/Atlanta.</li>
<li>Keep the ORL→JAX at market (short-haul bridge to better markets), then JAX→SAV/ATL reload into high-demand lanes.</li>

<h3 id="mode-by-mode-tactics">Mode-by-Mode Tactics 🔧</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Vans (Dry Van)</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Paid below posted = buyer’s edge. Negotiate buys using “posted vs paid” spread and offer quick tender + precise appointment windows.</li>
<li>Focus hubs with balanced capacity (Midwest) for cheaper buys; use those savings to support Southeast demand.</li>
<li>Limit exposure: 24-hour rate validity with refresh triggers if weather diverts capacity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reefers (Temperature-Controlled)</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Capacity is price sensitive and time sensitive; carriers value fast decisions and crystal-clear temp requirements.</li>
<li>Book around grocery and produce windows; build 90–120 minute appointment buffers today through Wednesday.</li>
<li>Offer carriers scheduled reloads and “no-touch + rapid pay status updates” (status, not payment terms) to win without overpaying.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flatbeds</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Construction/industrial energy lanes are in charge; show lane consistency to beat pure price.</li>
<li>Pre-qualify securement needs (chains/straps/tarps) in the first call to avoid late-stage rate hikes.</li>
<li>Lock 2–3 move commitments per carrier per week; carriers will trade 5–10 cpm margin for predictability.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="pricing-and-quoting-tactics-that-win-today">Pricing and Quoting Tactics That Win Today 💵</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Use banded quotes with time-boxed validity.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Example: “We’re at $2.70–$2.95/mi for reefer ATL→ORL; valid for 2 hours based on current live capacity. We’ll confirm within 30 minutes.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anchor shippers on paid>posted reality in reefer/flatbed; negotiate vans from the low end of posted.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Translate to dollars: “Reefer is clearing 4–6 cents over posted nationally; regionally it’s higher due to weather. We can secure if we act now.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Set internal walk-away rules.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Vans: avoid chasing beyond posted unless time-definite and margin is protected.</li>
<li>Reefers/Flatbeds: pre-set a maximum step-up (e.g., 8–12 cpm) before re-approaching the customer with a revised time-definite option.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Margin protection through reload control.</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>Book outbound first for FL. If you can’t secure a reload in 60–90 minutes, pause the inbound tender or reduce buy to reflect risk.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Call windows</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>7–10am local: Hit small fleets for today/tomorrow moves.</li>

<li>2–4pm: Re-check board fall-offs; deploy premium for mission-critical pickups.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Filter for reliability in tight markets</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">

<li>“You may see headlines calling for a spot softening this week. Our live data shows reefer and flatbed paid rates clearing above posted, especially in the Southeast. We’ll quote on real-time capacity, not noise—if rates break, you’ll benefit; if they firm, you’ll already be covered.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>“Operational insurance” positioning</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li>“You’re buying two protections: financial insurance on claims and operational insurance via our vetted carriers and proactive updates. The latter prevents the events that trigger claims—and that’s where we excel.”</li>
