    <h2>📊 Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>Spot market volumes continue to soften with 75,890 available loads totaling $95.3 million in opportunity, down from yesterday's 78,370 loads as weekend lulls deepen the decline observed over the past week, while paid rates show mixed resilience particularly in reefer segments amid selective carrier engagement. Flatbed and van equipment face downward pressure from surplus positioning, yet reefer premiums persist due to harvest-driven demand constraining specialized capacity. Brokers can capitalize on the Midwest region where capacity imbalances from recent weather events and industrial activity create arbitrage potential, extending yesterday's focus on distribution networks by targeting lanes with firming backhauls for margin expansion.</p>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Spot supply is in control; buy vans/flatbeds, sell targeted reefers.</strong> Total loads are down to 75,890 and the market avg is $2.03/mi; van paid ≈ posted ($1.87 vs $1.88), flatbed paid runs far under posted ($1.88 vs $2.19), while reefer paid exceeds posted ($2.34 vs $2.28).</li>
<li><strong>Midwest is today’s arbitrage center.</strong> Thunderstorm disruptions (IL/IN), plus steady industrial pulls, are tightening select lanes against a looser national backdrop—use Midwest backhaul engineering for margin.</li>
<li><strong>Weather risk is lane-specific.</strong> High wind warnings WY/CO (I-80/I-25) constrain high-profile/flatbed; severe storms IL/IN create day-of delays; localized flooding near FL I-95/DC access still justifies detours and buffers.</li>
<li><strong>OTRI (Outbound Tender Rejection Index) easing and diesel steady at $3.63/gal = negotiating leverage.</strong> Hold FSC baselines; push carriers on volume/loop commitments; expect Monday volume rebound to stabilize vans.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance is a sales edge.</strong> FMCSA enforcement sidelining 5,500 drivers increases premium on vetted English-proficient fleets; lead with compliance proof to win tight/temperature-sensitive work.</li>
