<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Market is stable with margin-friendly spreads</strong>: 77,589 loads, average $1.99/mi. Van spread is tight (posted $1.89 vs paid $1.86), reefer modest (posted $2.33 vs paid $2.26), flatbed wide (posted $2.20 vs paid $1.82). This favors brokers who move fast, control exits, and capture the flatbed negotiation gap.</li>
<li><strong>Southeast is the prime profit center</strong>: Imports via SAV/CHS/JAX + FL ag + infra work = highest hit-rate for repeatable wins. Build density ATL-CLT, JAX-BNA, SAV-ATL, CHS-GSP.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel tailwind enhances buy-side leverage</strong>: Diesel $3.689/gal and Iowa diesel at $3.50 create Midwest sourcing advantages. Use “fuel-arb” carriers to undercut noisy posted rates without sacrificing service.</li>
<li><strong>Weather requires surgical routing</strong>: FL St. Johns River flooding will delay Central FL P&D; MT mountain snow complicates northern transcons; freeze warnings in Southern ID shift reefer loading windows. Add time/miles buffers and protection language.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity is tight where specialization matters</strong>: Reefers in ag/import corridors and flatbeds on infra/steel lanes. Vans are balanced with a 3¢ spread—win on speed, reliability, and appointment control.</li>

<hr />

<h3 id="carrier-sourcing-and-dispatch-tactics">📞 Carrier Sourcing and Dispatch Tactics</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Southeast regionals</strong>: Prioritize carriers who love ATL-CLT day-runs; book next-day reload at time of pickup to maximize driver adoption.</li>

<h3 id="risk-mitigation-checklist">📌 Risk Mitigation Checklist</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Weather clauses</strong> in rate cons for MT/ID and Central FL; spell out chain control and flood detours. </li>
<li><strong>Detention/demurrage discipline</strong> at ports and job sites; pre-agree clocks. </li>
<li><strong>Insurance and equipment verification</strong> for flatbed securement; document chain/strap/tarp counts. </li>
<li><strong>FMCSA enforcement lens</strong>: Avoid carriers with recent OOS events; hold backups on critical loads.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="kpis-to-hit">📈 KPIs to Hit</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Coverage lead time</strong>: 80% of SE loads covered ≥4 hours pre-pickup. </li>
<li><strong>Flatbed margin</strong>: Average <strong>$300+</strong> per load on sub-600 miles; <strong>$500+</strong> for crane/permit moves. </li>
<li><strong>Reefer compliance</strong>: 100% temp trace received pre-delivery; zero temp-related claims. </li>
<li><strong>On-time performance</strong>: ≥97% on-time PU/DEL in SE focus lanes. </li>
<li><strong>Carrier mix</strong>: ≥30% sourced from IA/MW for long SE moves to leverage fuel arbitrage.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="broker-psychology-edge-use-it">🧠 Broker Psychology Edge (Use it)</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Anchor on service risk, not rate</strong>: Customers tolerate moderate premiums when you neutralize perceived risk (appointments, SOPs, weather routing). </li>
<li><strong>Scarcity framing on specialized capacity</strong>: For reefer/flatbed in SE, signal “we have two compliant options now; waiting pushes to Tuesday.” </li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity with carriers</strong>: Offer next-load commitments when asking for a $50–$100 rate giveback; driver planners value certainty more than a dime per mile.</li>
</ul>
