    <h2>📊 Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>The national spot market shows signs of cooling as we head into the weekend, with paid rates now trailing posted rates across all major equipment types. Van volumes are reportedly decreasing, giving brokers more negotiating leverage. Flatbed remains the most active segment by load volume, though rates have softened slightly from yesterday. Regional weather disruptions are concentrated in the Northern Plains (flooding) and Northeast (freezes), creating localized challenges, while the Southeast remains the most stable and opportunistic region for freight brokers.</p>

                <td colspan="2">The van market is softening, with paid rates averaging $1.78/mile, now four cents below the average posted rate of $1.82/mile. This widening negative spread, coupled with reports of an 8% drop in dry-van volume, indicates that capacity is outpacing the 15,000 available loads, shifting negotiating power to brokers. While driver availability is generally stable, the overall decrease in demand suggests carriers will be more willing to accept loads at or below posted rates to keep trucks moving, presenting an opportunity for brokers to improve margins on spot freight.</td>

                <td class="row-header">Reefers</td>
                <td colspan="2">The reefer market has cooled slightly, with the average paid rate of $2.20/mile falling below the posted average of $2.31/mile, a reversal from recent trends. This suggests that the peak of late-season produce shipping may be passing, easing the intense upward pressure on rates. With just over 5,700 loads available, demand remains specific and regional, but the national trend indicates that capacity is becoming more available. Brokers should find it easier to source reefer capacity without paying a significant premium over posted rates, though specialized lanes will still command higher prices.</td>

    <h2>🗺️ Regional & Lane Analysis</h2>
    <h3>📍 Primary Region Focus: Southeast</h3>
    <p>The Southeast remains the most attractive region for brokers due to its diverse freight base, high-volume lanes, and relative insulation from the major weather disruptions affecting other parts of the country. The market combines steady manufacturing and retail demand with late-season agricultural freight, creating a dynamic but relatively stable operating environment. While national trends show a cooling market, key hubs like Atlanta, Charlotte, and Jacksonville continue to see significant freight velocity.</p>
    
    <h3>🛣️ Key Lane Watch</h3>
    
<p><strong>Atlanta, GA → Charlotte, NC:</strong> <p>This high-volume, short-haul lane is experiencing the effects of the national van market slowdown. With ample capacity, carriers are actively seeking loads to ensure high utilization. Demand remains strong due to the density of distribution centers, but the supply of trucks is currently outpacing it, putting downward pressure on rates.</p></p>
        
<p><strong>Jacksonville, FL → Nashville, TN:</strong> <p>This lane connects a major port with an inland distribution hub. While some late-season produce is still moving, the peak has passed, easing reefer and van capacity. Freight is now more heavily weighted towards consumer goods and industrial products. Carriers are seeking loads out of Florida to reposition for better opportunities in the Midwest.</p></p>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>All three major equipment types have flipped broker-favorable</strong>: <strong>paid &lt; posted</strong> on van (−$0.04/mi), reefer (−$0.11/mi), and flatbed (−$0.03/mi). Treat posted as a ceiling, not a floor.</li>
<li><strong>Van demand down 8% with ~15k loads</strong>: <strong>capacity outpacing demand</strong>. Push buys below posted and reprice recurring lanes today.</li>
<li><strong>Reefer cool-off has begun</strong>: <strong>late-season produce easing</strong>; easier coverage without paying premiums except on specialized lanes.</li>
<li><strong>Flatbed still volume leader (~27k loads) but well supplied</strong>: focus on speed-to-lock and stringing loads to win margin.</li>
<li><strong>Southeast is the profit center</strong>: stable demand, minimal weather risk, plus capacity inflows from weather-impacted regions create a 3–5 day window to buy down.</li>
<li><strong>OTRI (Outbound Tender Rejection Index) likely dropping</strong>: carriers will stick to contracts more; spot will be price-taker’s market.</li>
<li><strong>Diesel steady at $3.70/gal</strong>: keep fuel surcharge floating and hold linehaul where possible.</li>

<li><strong>Weather</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Northern Plains (SD)</strong>: Minor river flooding in Brown/Spink/Jones/Stanley; local P&amp;D delays through weekend. Expect normalization Tuesday.</li>
<li><strong>Northeast interior</strong>: Freeze warnings Sat–Sun AM; light operational delays for temperature-sensitive freight.</li>
<li><strong>Florida (St. Johns near Astor)</strong>: Localized last-mile impacts only; broader operations stable.</li>

<li><strong>Finance/Economics</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Grain export slowdown</strong> freeing Midwestern trucks (hopper/flatbed) to chase industrial freight; pull them into manufacturing corridors and SE DCs.</li>
<li><strong>Small-carrier margin pressure</strong> will increase acceptance at lower buys if you trade certainty and efficient plans.</li>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Posted vs. Paid is your lever</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Van</strong>: −$0.04/mi spread. Push bids 3–6% under posted on non-urgent freight.</li>
<li><strong>Reefer</strong>: −$0.11/mi spread. Book at or below posted except for strict retail/DCs and specialized commodities.</li>
<li><strong>Flatbed</strong>: −$0.03/mi spread. Speed wins—book quickly and string 2–3 loads.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regional imbalances</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Midwest surplus</strong> from grain softness → redirect into <strong>Southeast</strong> or <strong>Central manufacturing</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Florida inbound/outbound dynamics</strong>: Carriers want exits from FL; bundle return or northbound reload to shave buys.</li>

<h3 id="where-to-hunt-capacity-next-72-hours">🧭 Where to Hunt Capacity (Next 72 Hours)</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Southeast (primary)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Why</strong>: High velocity, stable weather, inbound capacity migration.</li>
<li><strong>Moves</strong>: GA/FL origins to Carolinas/TN/AL; bundle reloads 100–200 miles north to keep cpm down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Midwest (secondary)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Why</strong>: Grain slowdown frees trucks; flatbed/van more negotiable.</li>
<li><strong>Moves</strong>: IL/IN/IA to Southeast DCs and manufacturing nodes; fill backhauls with building materials and machinery.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Northeast interior (tactical)</strong>:
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Why</strong>: Freeze risk creates early morning hiccups; carriers may avoid rural AM pickups—price slight buffers and pick up the freight others avoid.</li>

<h3 id="action-calendar-do-this-first">⏱ Action Calendar (Do This First)</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Morning (Now–11:30)</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Reprice van lanes</strong> with posted-as-ceiling bids, prioritize SE origins and MW→SE flows.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-book reefer</strong> for FL/GA weekend pickups with strict QC; avoid overpaying—market has flipped.</li>

<h3 id="why-this-works-behavioral-edge">🧠 Why This Works (Behavioral Edge)</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Certainty beats price</strong>: Carriers in a cooling market discount for guaranteed reloads and low dwell.</li>
<li><strong>Specificity builds trust</strong>: Share exact NWS alerts, QC steps, and appointment plans; this wins capacity even when your rate isn’t the highest.</li>
<li><strong>Short decision windows</strong>: Quote validity at 60–90 minutes prevents slow-roll countering and locks spreads while they’re favorable.</li>
