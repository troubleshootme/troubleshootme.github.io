    <h2>üìä Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>The national freight market continues a week-long trend of decreasing load volumes, yet rate dynamics are diverging sharply by equipment type, creating a complex but opportunity-rich environment for brokers. Paid rates for both van and reefer equipment are now outpacing posted averages, signaling a tightening of effective capacity and increased carrier pricing power, a notable shift for reefers compared to yesterday. Extreme heat across the Southwest and Southeast is the primary operational challenge, stressing refrigerated capacity and creating significant regional rate volatility that savvy brokers can capitalize on.</p>
