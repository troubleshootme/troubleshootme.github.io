    <h2>üìä Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>The national freight market is experiencing a surge in volume across all major equipment types, with total available loads climbing to over 115,000. Despite this increased demand, rate growth is uneven. Van and reefer paid rates are ticking up, indicating tightening capacity, while flatbed rates show signs of softening as the paid average falls below the posted average. Extreme heat continues to disrupt capacity in the Southwest and Southeast, creating significant challenges and premium rate opportunities for reefer freight. Meanwhile, severe thunderstorms and localized flooding in the Southeast and Midwest are causing short-term operational delays. Brokers should focus on the volatility in the reefer market for margin opportunities while capitalizing on high volumes in the more stable van and flatbed sectors.</p>

                <td colspan="2">The van market is showing strong signs of life as available loads have increased to 19,878. This surge in demand is creating upward pressure on rates, with the average paid rate climbing to $1.84/mile, a full $0.10 above the average posted rate of $1.74/mile. This widening spread indicates that capacity is tightening and carriers hold significant pricing power for immediate availability. While overall driver availability is improving nationally, regional disruptions from weather are creating spot shortages, forcing brokers to compete more aggressively on desirable lanes.</td>

                <td colspan="2">The reefer market remains highly volatile, driven by persistent, extreme heat across the southern states and a corresponding increase in available loads to 7,321. The average paid rate of $2.21/mile is slightly above the posted rate of $2.19/mile, reflecting a strained market where any available temperature-controlled unit is in high demand. The intense heat is not only boosting demand for climate-controlled goods but also stressing equipment and reducing driver willingness to operate in affected regions, leading to elevated tender rejections and premium rates on critical lanes.</td>

                <td colspan="2">Flatbed continues to dominate the market in sheer volume, with available loads reaching 37,149. However, a notable shift is occurring in rate dynamics; the average paid rate has settled at $2.20/mile, slightly below the average posted rate of $2.24/mile. This suggests that while demand from construction and industrial sectors is robust, capacity is currently sufficient to meet it, giving brokers a slight negotiating advantage. This presents an opportunity to secure capacity at or below posted rates, a contrast to the more inflationary van and reefer segments.</td>

            Schneider, a major industry bellwether, has adjusted its full-year earnings guidance down, signaling that even large carriers are struggling with profitability in the current market. For brokers, this is a critical insight: carriers are feeling the squeeze. This can mean more willingness to accept fair spot rates for consistent freight but also a harder line on accessorials like fuel and detention. Use this as a talking point with shippers to explain the real costs carriers are facing.

It is the biggest British military operation since the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the biggest in Ireland since the Irish War of Independence.
