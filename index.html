    <h2>üìä Top-Line Summary</h2>
    <p>The freight market presents a complex picture of weakening long-term fundamentals against resilient short-term spot market conditions. Major carriers report declining profits and industrial freight uncertainty, yet real-time load board data reveals carriers are securing rates above initial postings for van and reefer loads, indicating persistent capacity tightness in key segments. The federal government's withdrawal of the speed limiter mandate provides a tailwind for carrier efficiency. The Southeast remains the epicenter of broker opportunity, driven by seasonal produce, port activity, and rate volatility, while widespread heatwaves across the central and southern US will challenge driver productivity and equipment availability.</p>

                <td colspan="2">The van market is exhibiting signs of carrier leverage in spot negotiations, with the average paid rate of $1.82/mile slightly exceeding the average posted rate of $1.80/mile. This dynamic, occurring across more than 22,000 available loads, suggests that while rates are down significantly from the week-ago average of $2.02/mile, the available capacity is successfully demanding a premium on immediate-need freight. Brokers should anticipate this upward pressure in negotiations, as carriers are capitalizing on tight capacity in desirable lanes to counter broader market softness.</td>

                <td colspan="2">Reefer capacity remains scarce and commands a premium, a trend underscored by average paid rates ($2.21/mile) climbing well above posted rates ($2.16/mile). With only around 11,000 loads available nationally, demand from ongoing produce seasons continues to outstrip supply, giving carriers substantial pricing power. While the current paid rate is below the week-ago average of $2.31/mile, the significant positive spread between paid and posted rates indicates that any available reefer capacity is being booked at a premium, requiring brokers to act decisively and price aggressively to secure trucks.</td>

            <td colspan="2"><strong>$3.741/gal</strong> - Diesel prices have ticked up slightly, maintaining pressure on carrier operating margins. This stability at an elevated level means fuel costs remain a critical component of carrier negotiations and a headwind to their overall profitability.</td>

        <tr>
            <td class="row-header">OTRI Trends</td>
            <td colspan="2">Tender rejection trends will likely diverge by equipment type. For van and especially reefer, the positive spread between paid and posted spot rates creates a strong incentive for carriers to reject lower-paying contract freight. Flatbed rejections may be less pronounced as the spot market shows more rate stability, making contract compliance more attractive.</td>

        </ul>
    </div>
            
    <h2>üí∞ Financial Market Indicators</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diesel Futures:</strong> Diesel futures remain sensitive to global supply dynamics and domestic demand. While prices are currently stable, any significant geopolitical event or economic shift could introduce volatility, impacting carrier costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrier Financial Health:</strong> Recent earnings reports from major asset-based carriers like Knight-Swift and rail operators like CSX indicate falling profits and revenue, citing persistent uncertainty in industrial markets. This suggests a softer long-term outlook, though it contrasts with the immediate pricing power seen in the spot market.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Indicators:</strong> Ongoing discussions around tariffs on imported goods continue to create uncertainty. An extension of some tariff deals may stabilize certain import flows, but new tariffs taking effect could shift shipping patterns and volumes, particularly for West Coast ports and inland distribution.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>üì∞ Impactful News Analysis</h2>
    <ol>
    
        <li>
            <strong><a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/feds-axe-truck-speed-limiter-mandate-citing-data-gaps" target="_blank" style="color: #00adf1; text-decoration: none;">Speed Limiter Mandate Officially Withdrawn by Federal Regulators</a> üîó:</strong><br>
            The DOT's decision to pull the speed limiter rulemaking is a major victory for carriers, eliminating a significant operational threat. For brokers, this means capacity will not be artificially constrained by speed restrictions, preserving transit time efficiency. This is a positive talking point for carrier relations, acknowledging a win for their operational autonomy.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/csx-quarterly-profit-sales-fall-as-uncertainty-persists-among-industrial-markets-a97f112a" target="_blank" style="color: #00adf1; text-decoration: none;">Major Rail Carrier CSX Reports Declining Profits, Citing Industrial Market Uncertainty</a> üîó:</strong><br>
            CSX's performance signals weakness in the industrial and manufacturing sectors, which could translate to softer flatbed and van demand in the medium term. This provides brokers with a key insight for customer conversations, particularly with industrial shippers, and suggests that intermodal competition may lessen if rail volumes continue to fall.
        </li>
        
        <li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>üó∫Ô∏è Regional & Lane Analysis</h2>
    <h3>üìç Primary Region Focus: Southeast</h3>
    <p>The Southeast remains the most dynamic and opportunity-rich region for freight brokers. It is the focal point of the reefer market due to peak produce season in Georgia and Florida, creating intense competition for capacity that spills over into the van market. High-volume ports like Savannah and Jacksonville are processing significant import volumes, driving strong demand for inland distribution. This convergence of agricultural, retail, and industrial freight creates significant rate volatility and arbitrage opportunities.</p>
    
    <h3>üõ£Ô∏è Key Lane Watch</h3>
    
<p><strong>Atlanta, GA ‚Üí Orlando, FL:</strong> <p>This high-volume lane is experiencing intense demand for both van and reefer equipment. Outbound Atlanta capacity is tight due to its role as a major distribution hub, while inbound freight to Orlando is driven by relentless consumer demand and retail replenishment. Reefer demand from south Georgia is pulling capacity out of the Atlanta market, further tightening conditions.</p></p>
        
<p><strong>Savannah, GA ‚Üí Charlotte, NC:</strong> <p>This lane is dominated by import freight moving from the Port of Savannah to the Charlotte inland distribution hub. Demand is currently strong for vans to handle container deconsolidation. Drayage capacity at the port can be a bottleneck, causing delays and creating urgent demand for trucks once freight is ready.</p></p>
        
    <h2>üö® Actionable Alerts</h2>
    <div class="alert-box">
        <h3>Rate Spike Warnings:</h3>
        <ul>
    <li>Reefer lanes originating in the Southeast (GA, FL).</li><li>Van lanes out of major distribution hubs like Atlanta, GA and Dallas, TX.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Capacity Shortage Alerts:</h3>
        <ul>
    <li>Reefer capacity is critically tight nationwide, especially in the Southeast. Van capacity is tight in major markets but more available in peripheral areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Opportunity Zones:</h3>
        <ul>
    <li>The entire Southeast region, for brokers who can source reliable capacity.</li><li>Backhaul lanes out of Florida and other consumption-heavy markets.</li></ul></div>
    <h2>üéØ Strategic Recommendations for Today</h2>
    <div class="recommendation-box">
        <h3>üíº For Customer Sales:</h3>
        <p><strong>Narrative:</strong> While major carriers are reporting a softer market, the real-time spot market for immediate needs remains very competitive, especially in the Southeast. We are seeing carriers successfully demand higher-than-posted rates for reliable service. Let's work together to secure capacity in advance to protect your supply chain from price spikes and delays.</p>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> Proactively contact all customers shipping into or out of the Southeast to discuss capacity planning for the next 1-2 weeks. Use the carrier earnings data to show you understand the macro market but pivot to real-time data to explain current costs.</p>
    
        <h3>üöõ For Carrier Reps:</h3>
        <p><strong>Sourcing Focus:</strong> Concentrate sourcing efforts on carriers based in GA, FL, and the Carolinas. Prioritize building relationships with reefer carriers who may also have vans. Inquire about TWIC-compliant drivers for port opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>Negotiation Leverage:</strong> The withdrawal of the speed limiter mandate is a positive talking point‚Äîacknowledge it as a win for them. Use your knowledge of tight capacity in their preferred lanes to build partnerships. Offer attractive backhauls to secure capacity on tougher headhaul lanes.</p>
