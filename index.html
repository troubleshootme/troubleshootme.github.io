                <td colspan="2">Reefer markets remain notably tight with paid rates at $2.34/mile surpassing posted averages of $2.26/mile on only 11,830 loads, as seasonal produce harvests from key agricultural regions drive demand that outpaces specialized equipment availability, forcing carriers to be selective and increasing empty backhauls in non-perishable areas. Capacity constraints are amplified by driver preferences for premium temperature-controlled runs and positioning challenges in the Southwest and West Coast, where weather-related detours add to operational costs and limit flexibility; fall cooling trends are boosting cold chain needs for perishables, leading to regional variations with firmer conditions in produce-heavy zones compared to surplus in urban distribution hubs. With loads increasing week-over-week, the outlook suggests continued premium pricing if export volumes rise, allowing brokers to capitalize on high-value shipments by locking in dedicated reefer carriers ahead of potential holiday surges.</td>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Target profiles</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Reefer:</strong> Carriers with harvest history and export SOPs; offer today+48h bundle to reduce repositioning risk.</li>
<li><strong>Van (SE):</strong> Regional fleets with DC experience and hurricane/flood SOP knowledge; pay prompt and pre-authorized detour adds.</li>
<li><strong>Flatbed:</strong> Crews with verifiable securement/training; offer weekly volume blocks to anchor below posted rates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leverage points that convert today</strong>
<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Transparency wins:</strong> Share NWS/DOT alert IDs and pre-approved adds on the rate con. Carriers accept slightly lower linehaul when risk is documented and paid.</li>
<li><strong>Reload certainty:</strong> Attach the reload details in the tender; use “first-100-miles check-call” incentive for tighter compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Counter pushes:</strong> Cite current paid means (van $1.91, reefer $2.34, flat $2.21) and offer adds separately instead of lifting base rate.</li>

<h3 id="risk-compliance-controls-copypaste-to-ops-checklist">🛡️ Risk &amp; Compliance Controls (Copy/Paste to Ops Checklist)</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Weather Rider:</strong> Include NWS alert IDs, authorized alternate routes, compensable events, and ELD/photo proof requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Reefer SOP:</strong> Pre-cool photo, driver on-duty temp confirmation, pulp temps at PU/DEL, continuous-run notation, seal number on BOL, “break-of-seal protocol.”</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Fraud:</strong> Match MC, phone, email domain and bank; geo-tagged pickup photos; “no double brokering” clause; live pings at PU and first-100 miles.</li>
<li><strong>Detention Management:</strong> Pre-schedule appointments; “free time” clearly stated; start clock via timestamped check-in photo; escalate at 75 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Wind/Chain Protocol (Flat/Oversize):</strong> No high-profile through &gt;45 mph gusts; chain pay $100–$200; add 12–24 hour weather buffers in Mountain West.</li>
<li><strong>ELP/CDL Compliance Narrative:</strong> Emphasize partnership with vetted fleets as standards tighten; use to justify rate premiums for compliant capacity.</li>

<h3 id="talk-tracks-that-win-today">📣 Talk Tracks That Win Today</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Southeast shipper (time-critical):</strong> “We’ll protect your OTIF through I-95 detours with a documented routing plan and pre-approved weather adds. Paid>posted on vans/reefers confirms selective tightness—locking now avoids afternoon premiums.”</li>
<li><strong>Cost-sensitive shipper (flexible delivery):</strong> “National spot is averaging ~$2.15/mi. If we flex delivery by 24 hours and avoid the flood corridors, we can keep you at base with zero service risk.”</li>
<li><strong>Reefer carrier (harvest lane):</strong> “Temperature SOP is tight, detour add is approved on the rate con, and we’ve got your reload within 50 miles. You’ll run paid miles all week without guesswork.”</li>
<li><strong>Flatbed carrier (industrial):</strong> “Standard steel, tarp pay included, crane delay after 1 hour. We’ll slot you into a 3-load week at consistent windows to keep your rate firm.”</li>

<li><strong>Van modest firmness (55–65%):</strong> Retail pre-stocking sustains demand; SE still volatile while floods recede; target time-definite DC pulls.</li>
<li><strong>Flatbed stabilizes (50–60%):</strong> High load count but pricing disciplined; pay up only when crane windows/securement/terrain justify.</li>
<li><strong>Southeast flood ripple (50–60%):</strong> Expect inbound recovery freight and detour premiums for 24–48 hours; prepare for a quick reversion afterward—don’t over-commit beyond 72 hours.</li>

<h3 id="6-hour-action-sprint-do-these-first">⏱️ 6-Hour Action Sprint (Do These First)</h3>

<ul class="wwsbd-list">
<li><strong>Call SE shippers with flood routing plans</strong> and lock spot coverage now; attach NWS alert IDs to quotes.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-book reefer capacity</strong> on harvest/export lanes for next 48–72 hours with SOP enforcement; bundle out+back.</li>
<li><strong>Reprice your flatbed board</strong> at or slightly below posted for standard freight; upsell crane-window control where applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Stage backhauls into ATL/JAX/MIA</strong> using Midwest/Northeast surplus vans; convert to headhauls within 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Issue a compliance brief to sales</strong>: “Paid>posted in van/reefer; FSC steady; weather/chain adds approved.” Aligns pricing talk and speeds approvals.</li>
